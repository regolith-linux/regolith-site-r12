Regolith is a unique desktop environment that ditches the cruft of Windows and Mac knockoffs to provide a productive and beautiful place to get work done. Built on top of Ubuntu and GNOME, Regolith stands on a stable, well-supported, and consistent foundation.

<br/>Upon login, Regolith is relatively free of clutter.  A bar at the bottom provides important information such as the time and active workspace.

For those that do most of their work in the terminal, pressing `<super>`-`<enter>` is all it takes to get to business:

Need more terminals?  Toggle between horizontal and vertical layouts with `<super>`-`<backspace>`:

Launching apps is as simple as `<super>`-`<space>`, type a few letters of the app you're looking for and press `<enter>` to launch it:

`gnome-flashback` provides consistent and simple system management.  Tweak your UI, auto mount your USB drives, connect to a wireless router:

Toggle an overlay via `<super>`-`<?>` that presents the most important keybindings until they become muscle-memory:

Big on multitasking?  Quickly find the window you're looking for via `<super>`-`<ctrl>`-`<space>`, or navigate over workspaces with `<super>`-`<number>`:

<a href="/assets/screenshot-window.png"><img class="screenshot" alt="Conky Screenshot" src="/assets/screenshot-window.png"/></a><br/>

Waste no space on frivolous UI and take advantage of every pixel without micro-managing your window layouts:
